IMPROVING CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY FOR THE EFFECTIVE DIAGNOSIS OF DISEASES USING HYBRID MODEL

This postgraduate project focuses on building a hybrid machine learning model capable of accurately predicting multiple medical conditions using Python. The system works with five healthcare datasets: Heart Disease, Diabetes, Lung Cancer, Liver Disease, and Hepatitis. Each dataset undergoes preprocessing, analysis, and classification to evaluate disease risk. The final hybrid model integrates multiple algorithms to improve classification accuracy and provide reliable diagnostic support.

The main objective of this work is to enhance disease prediction accuracy by combining machine learning techniques under a unified pipeline. The project strengthens practical knowledge of real-world ML workflows, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model building, evaluation, and deployment. A user-friendly interface is also developed to allow users to input values and visualize the prediction using a 180-degree semicircle severity meter.

Python and its scientific libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, and seaborn are used extensively. Streamlit or Flask is used to develop the interface that communicates with the trained models and displays disease predictions. The hybrid modeling approach, which includes algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, XGBoost, and Stacking Classifier, significantly improves the overall performance, achieving accuracies around or above 90% across the datasets.

Preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical data, scaling numerical features, removing outliers, and splitting data into training and testing sets. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices are used to assess model effectiveness. The best-performing models are saved as .pkl files for deployment.

The UI component allows users to select the disease type, enter medical input values, and receive a prediction. The output includes both the classification result and a visual severity indicator represented through a semi-circular gauge meter to enhance interpretability for non-technical users.

Key learning outcomes include mastering the full ML workflow, applying supervised learning techniques, performing hyperparameter optimization, building hybrid models, and deploying ML systems with interactive user interfaces. The project effectively demonstrates how hybrid machine learning models can improve diagnostic accuracy across multiple diseases.

Future extensions may include incorporating deep learning architectures, expanding the dataset collection, integrating explainability tools like SHAP, developing mobile app integration, and transitioning to a cloud-based API model for wider scalability.
